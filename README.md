# SQLZoo-HelpDesk-Challenge

Scenario: A software company has been successful in selling its products to a number of customer organisations, and there is now a high demand for technical support. There is already a system in place for logging support calls taken over the telephone and assigning them to engineers, but it is based on a series of spreadsheets. With the growing volume of data, using the spreadsheet system is becoming slow, and there is a significant risk that errors will be made.
